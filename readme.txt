Custom Post Type that takes a URI and automatically takes regular screenshots of that site to use in a gallery or  showcase of websites.

== Description ==
= Overview =
This plugin registers a new post type 'site'. Each site (obviously) has a URL, this used to generate screenshots of the site on a regular basis (or only on user request). These images can be easily then used throughout your site.
Automatic screenshots requires an [Page2Images](http://www.page2images.com) account (from free).

* Easy setup.
* See websites as it would appear on different platforms including Iphone 4 and 5 and android phones.
* Secure API.
* locally stored images (reduces valuable API calls), full history of site vieweable
* More APIs coming (get more choice about where the screenshots are coming from).
* Free Full version.
* First of (hopefully) many plugins by myself.
